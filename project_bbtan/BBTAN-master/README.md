# BBTAN

My python version of the fantastic mobile game [BBTAN](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crater.bbtan).
It's built on [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/), a browser-based python interpreter.

## Usage

Copy the code to [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/), and then run it by pressing the "Play" button on the top left.
> Note: Don't run it in full-screen mode on Mac, due to some JavaScript issue.
